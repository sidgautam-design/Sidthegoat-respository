## Overview
This directory contains my Python programming projects, showcasing my journey in learning and applying Python concepts. These projects demonstrate my understanding of fundamental programming principles, user interaction, and problem-solving skills.

## Projects

### Math Quiz Game (`mathquiz.py`)
An interactive math quiz application that challenges users with random arithmetic problems.

**Features:**
- Generates random math problems with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Ensures division problems result in integer answers for simplicity
- Provides multiple attempts for each question
- Tracks and displays the user's score
- Implements error handling for invalid inputs

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Function definitions and calls
- Random number generation
- User input handling and validation
- Conditional logic and loops
- String formatting

### Basic Python Concepts (`sid.py`)
A simple script demonstrating fundamental Python concepts and syntax.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Variable declaration and naming conventions (Snake Case, Camel Case)
- Different data types (strings, integers, floats)
- Comments and documentation
- Conditional statements
- Basic user input and output

## Learning Journey
These projects represent my early steps in Python programming. Through these exercises, I've gained a solid understanding of core programming concepts that will serve as a foundation for more complex projects in the future.

## Future Directions
I plan to expand my Python portfolio with more advanced projects, including:
- Web applications using frameworks like Flask or Django
- Data analysis and visualization projects
- Game development with Pygame
- Machine learning applications
