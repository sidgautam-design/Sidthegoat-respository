## Overview
This directory contains my journey learning C++ programming language and its applications in embedded systems. The projects demonstrate my understanding of C++ syntax, functions, and how to integrate C++ with Arduino for hardware control.

## Projects

### C++ Fundamentals (`c++1.cpp`)
A comprehensive introduction to C++ programming concepts and syntax.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Variable types (int, bool, float, double, string, char)
- Constants and their usage
- Comments (single-line and multi-line)
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Function definitions and calls
- Basic input/output operations

### Arduino Integration (`learn` directory)
A collection of files demonstrating how C++ can be used with Arduino for hardware control.

**Components:**
- **MyFunctions.h**: Header file defining LED control functions
- **MyFunctions.cpp**: Implementation of LED control functions
- **learn.ino**: Arduino sketch integrating IoT Cloud and servo control

**Features:**
- IoT Cloud integration for remote control
- Servo motor control via cloud dashboard
- WiFi connectivity for IoT applications

## Skills Demonstrated
- C++ syntax and programming concepts
- Header file creation and implementation
- Arduino programming
- IoT device programming
- Hardware control through software

## Learning Resources
During my C++ learning journey, I've utilized various resources including:
- Online tutorials and documentation
- Arduino reference materials
- IoT Cloud documentation

## Future Projects
I plan to expand my C++ knowledge with more advanced projects such as:
- Object-oriented programming applications
- More complex Arduino-based systems
- Integration with other sensors and actuators
- Real-world IoT applications
